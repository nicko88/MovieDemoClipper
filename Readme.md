### How To Use
* Open up MovieDemoClipper.
* Drag and drop in a movie file or open a movie in MPC-BE/HC.
* Seek the movie to a point where you want your clip to start, then next to "Clip Start:" press "Select Prev" or "Select Next" Keyframe.
* Seek the movie to a point where you want your clip to end, then next to "Clip End:" press "Select Prev" or "Select Next" Keyframe.
* You can continue clicking the Select Next / Select Prev Keyframe buttons to refine your "Clip Start" and "Clip End" points.
* You can also click on the timecodes in the middle to seek your media player to the currently selected time so you can easily see where your clip will start and end.
* Click "Save Clip", pick a name and folder, and click "Save".
* Wait for the clip to be created by the console window.

### Notes
* Since MovieDemoClipper is designed to losslessly cut clips, it can only clip the video at "keyframes".  This is why it only allows you to select keyframes for the start and stop points.  This ensures that you will see in your media player the exact frames that the video will ultimately be clipped at.
* Web interface "Listen on port:" must be enabled in your MPC-BE/HC player options and set to the default port: 13579
