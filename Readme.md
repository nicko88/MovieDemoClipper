### How To Use
* Open up MovieDemoClipper.
* Drag in a movie file or open a movie in MPC-BE/HC.
* Seek the movie to a point where you want your clip to start and press "Select Clip Start".
* Seek the movie to a point where you want your clip to end and press "Select Clip End".
* Click "Save Clip", pick a name and folder and click "Save".
* Wait for the clip to be created by the console window.

### Notes
* Web interface "Listen on port:" must be enabled in your MPC-BE/HC player options.
* Clip start/end time will not be prefect to the frame you choose because original quality clipping can only clip at video keyframes.
* At this time MovieDemoClipper will keep all audio tracks and remove all subtitles (looking to improve this in future versions).
